## Dragon Tetris
I wrote Tetris in DragonRuby before realizing Ryan already did it.
Based on my older one [sdl2-tetris](https://github.com/andwn/sdl2-tetris).

### Play It
Visit the [itch.io page](https://grind.itch.io/dragon-tetris).

### Build It
0. Purchase DragonRuby, extract the zip for your OS somewhere
1. From within the extracted directory, `git clone https://github.com/andwn/dragon-tetris`
2. Run like `./dragonruby dragon-tetris`
